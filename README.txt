Study about selection on flowering phenology in the perennial plant Gentiana pneumonanthe by the butterfly seed predator Phengaris alcon. 

Data comes from 20 populations of G. pneumonanthe located in the county of Västra Götaland (Sweden) and surveyed during two years (2010-11).

We investigated if differences in the direction of phenotypic selection on flowering phenology were related to the presence of the butterfly, and if butterfly incidence was associated with the abundance of the butterfly’s second host, Myrmica ants. 

We used phenotypic selection analyses and path analyses.

We found that in plant populations without the butterfly, phenotypic selection favored earlier flowering. In populations where the butterfly was present, caterpillars preferentially attacked early-flowering individuals, shifting the direction of selection to favoring later flowering. Butterfly incidence in plant populations increased with ant abundance. 

These results demonstrate that antagonistic interactions can shift the direction of selection on flowering phenology, and suggest that such shifts might be associated with differences in the community context.
